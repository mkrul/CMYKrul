                        Due to security risks, I am unable to draw an image from an outside domain into an 
                        HTML canvas. I had originally wanted to draw images directly from the Spoonflower 
                        website, but I was forced to use images residing inside my Cloud 9 workspace.
                    </p>

                        Global variables should generally be avoided because they clutter 
                        up global namespace, can cause naming collisions, and are slower 
                        to 'find' than local variables. The solution for this was to wrap 
                        globals inside of a unique namespace / object.
                    </p>

                        When clearing the HTML canvas, ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, 
                        canvas.height); is more memory-efficient than canvas.width = 
                        canvas.width. The first method clears the entire canvas state including 
                        many of the canvas's attributes.  This method is also faster on most 
                        browsers.

                        Pressing the 'enter' key after entering data into an input field does 
                        not yield the same result as physically clicking the submit button.  
                        This behavior must be coded into the webpage manually.

                        Rick suggested using local storage to store image data so that
                        images could be 'sent' from one page to another.  This worked well 
                        enough given the scope and purpose of the project, but overall 
                        functionality could have been improved by using an actual database.

                        During the earlier stages of development, I began work on the 'mobile' 
                        and 'tablet' views first, which I tested using BrowserStack.  It was 
                        during this testing phase when I discovered some styling inconsistencies 
                        between platforms, such as radio buttons were breaking out of their container 
                        divs on most mobile devices.  Amy recommended using a CSS clearfix, but 
                        unfortunately that did not correct the problem.  I believe this is probably 
                        an issue with the default styling of radio buttons on certain phones and tablets.
                        I added normalize.css to try and 'equalize' the appearance of the 
                        webpage(s) across all platforms, but this didn't help either.
                        <br></br>
                        I feel that a better solution for the radio button and input elements on 
                        the mobile view would be to make them into "Price is right"-style scroll 
                        wheels instead, but I was unable to find some good working examples of these 
                        types of menus on the Internet.
                    </p>

                        I attempted to include an easter egg when a user plays with the app 
                        on October 31st, but encountered some unexpected issues with the program 
                        not recognizing specific date formats properly.

                        Ultimately, the program is not capable of sorting images by their RGB 
                        values.  I attempted to use some existing libraries (such as 
                        ColorThief and psColor) to get the program to sort images by RGB, but 
                        present gaps in my knowledge are preventing me from using these Libraries 
                        to achieve my goal.
